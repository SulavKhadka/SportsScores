# Sports Scores
A python script to retrieve game scores of different sports and leagues. Built with the intention to integrate into my CHESTER project.

## Updates:

**1st commit**:
 - Basic match-up retrieval of current date for NBA/MLB/NHL completed.
 - Can't extract scores yet. The page response I get doesnt have anything inside the score tag, while it shows up when looking at "Page Source" on google.
 - Super basic has no logging or storing just prints stuff out. 

### More updates to come as I work on it more.
